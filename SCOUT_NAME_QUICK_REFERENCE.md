## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I change the auto-filled name?
**Yes!** Just tap the field and edit it.

### Will it remember my edit?
**Yes**, until you reset the form or restart the app. The next time you open the form, it will auto-fill again.

### What if I log in with a different account?
The scout name will auto-fill with the **new** username.

### What if I want to scout as someone else?
Just edit the scout name field to the desired name.

### Will it affect my submissions?
No, the scout name is sent in the submission data as before. The only difference is where the field appears on the form.

## Troubleshooting

### Scout name is empty when I open the form
**Possible causes:**
- Haven't logged in yet
- Logged in before this update (will fix on next login)
- Logged out (username cleared)

**Solution:**
- Log out and log back in
- Manually type your name (works as before)

### Scout name shows old username
**Cause:** You switched accounts but the old username is still cached

**Solution:**
- Log out completely
- Log back in with new account
- Scout name will update

### Can't edit the scout name
**Unlikely, but if it happens:**
- Reset the form
- Reload the page
- Restart the app

## For Developers

### Files Modified:
1. `SettingsService.cs` - Username storage
2. `ApiService.cs` - Store username on login
3. `ScoutingViewModel.cs` - Auto-fill logic
4. `ScoutingPage.xaml.cs` - UI repositioning

### New Methods:
```csharp
// ISettingsService
Task<string?> GetUsernameAsync();
Task SetUsernameAsync(string? username);

// ScoutingViewModel
private async Task LoadScoutNameAsync();
```

### Debug Commands:
```csharp
// Get stored username
var username = await _settingsService.GetUsernameAsync();

// Manually set username
await _settingsService.SetUsernameAsync("custom_name");

// Clear username
await _settingsService.SetUsernameAsync(null);
```

## Summary

**Scout Name is now at the TOP of the form and AUTO-FILLS with your login username!** ??

You can still edit it if needed, but most of the time you won't have to!
